Since I am not participating this year, I have decided to create a lot of cryptography challenges. In here are the four challenges I created for the qualification of the Swedish Championship in Cyber Security 2024 and write-ups as well as solution scripts.

- **Really Secure Autput**

    ```
    Try to crack this one ;)
    ```

- **md10**

    ```
    I heard md5 was insecure so I thought I would give md10 a try :)
    ```

- **BlackSmith**

    ```
    Welcome to our store! Please tell us what you want to forge
    ```

- **rsAI**

    ```
    Artificial intelligence seems to be the solution to every problem nowadays, so
    I have now created a perfectly secure encryption scheme that uses the wonders of AI and RSA.
    E = mc^2 + AI !!!
    ```
