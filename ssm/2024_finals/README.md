As mentioned in the `2024_quals` README, I have decided to create cryptography tasks for this year's Swedish Championship in Cyber Security. I seemingly happened to be the one creating them all. In here you soon find the challenges I presented in the finals and write-ups as well as solutions scripts.

- **Pølse by Damgård [crypto] [500]**

    ```
    I heard that the Aarhus startup Pølse by Damgård has been attracting a lot of customers lately
    with his secret mustard recipe and a small sprinkle of salt and pepper. They also give a small
    sample to every new customer! Let's check it out!!!
    ```

- **Hellman & Diffie [crypto] [500]**

    ```
    Have you seen the new clothing store that just opened? H&D, Hellman & Diffie, is taking over
    every street and making a ton of profit. However, I also heard they are discussing top secret
    info about their business. Let's listen in and maybe we can also create our own successful
    clothing brand!

- **Nordic Aeronautics and Space Administration [crypto] [500]**

    ```
    Welcome to the Nordic Aeronautics and Space Administration. Our new discovery has led us to
    believe that our world can be created out of only singular hydrogen and helium atoms! We
    observed how neutrons and protons started merging as everything cooled down. Let me show you!

- **Ragnar's Runestones [crypto] [500]**

    ```
    Have you heard?! There is this new person in town called Ragnar who carves beautiful runestones
    for you. Unfortunately, some people have been jealous of his success since he has a massive vault
    full of penningar boasting his wealth. Due to this, they started tampering with the runestone
    requests customers were sending in, giving him a bad reputation. To solve this problem Ragnar
    invented a new system. Just send in the encrypted private key he gives out together with your
    encrypted message. If the runestone then doesn't come out as wished for, it is the customers
    fault. Ragnar is so confident in this system he even puts his encrypted vault password at
    display. Let's just get a runestone...
