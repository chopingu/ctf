Here you can find the powerpoint slides I used and created for a lecture I held at the 
2024 Swedish national bootcamp. It is about lattices and lattice reductions and how they
are used in cryptography. The slides were created using typst and mspaint.

PS. 
Observe that there is a slight mistake on slide 49 where the same weight W is used to
weight each column of the matrix. This of course effectively does nothing. Each column is
instead meant to have an individual weight W_i.
